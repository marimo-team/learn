# Learn Python

This collection of marimo notebooks is designed to teach you the basics
of the Python programming language.

**Running notebooks.** To run a notebook locally, use

```bash
uvx marimo edit <URL>
```

For example, run the numbers tutorial with

```bash
uvx marimo edit https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/python/001_numbers.py
```

You can also open notebooks in our online playground by appending `marimo.app/`
to a notebook's URL: [marimo.app/https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/python/001_numbers.py](https://marimo.app/https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/python/001_numbers.py).
