# Learn Calculus for Machine Learning

_üöß This collection is a work in progress. Please help us add notebooks!_

This collection of marimo notebooks is designed to teach you the basics of calculus for machine learning.

**Help us build this course! ‚öíÔ∏è**

We're seeking contributors to help us build these notebooks. Every contributor will be acknowledged as an author in this README and in their contributed notebooks. Head over to the [tracking issue](https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/issues/58) to sign up for a planned notebook or propose your own.

**Running notebooks.** To run a notebook locally, use

```bash
uvx marimo edit <file_url>
```

You can also open notebooks in our online playground by appending marimo.app/ to a notebook's URL.

**Thanks to all our notebook authors!**
