# Learn DuckDB

_🚧 This collection is a work in progress. Please help us add notebooks!_

This collection of marimo notebooks is designed to teach you the basics of
DuckDB, a fast in-memory OLAP engine that can interoperate with Dataframes.
These notebooks also show how marimo gives DuckDB superpowers.

**Help us build this course! ⚒️**

We're seeking contributors to help us build these notebooks. Every contributor
will be acknowledged as an author in this README and in their contributed
notebooks. Head over to the [tracking
issue](https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/issues/48) to sign up for a planned
notebook or propose your own.

**Running notebooks.** To run a notebook locally, use
