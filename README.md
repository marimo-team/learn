# 📚 Learn

This repository contains a curated collection of educational
[marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) notebooks. These Python notebooks,
organized into courses, explain fundamental concepts for an expanding set of
topics, including academic topics like computer science, linear algebra,
probability, and machine learning, as well as applied topics such as how to use
popular packages such as polars, pytorch, matplotlib, and more.

Our goal with `marimo learn` is to create a central repository of high quality
notebooks for educators, students, and practitioners.

- ⚖️ [Optimization](optimization/): Learn how to solve optimization problems, with applications to finance and control

**Coming soon.** 

- 🎲 Probability
- 📏 Linear algebra
- ❄️ Polars

- 📈 matplotlib


_We're seeking contributions! If you'd like to contribute, please [reach out](https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/issues/new?template=example_request.yaml)._

## Adding notebooks

We welcome community contributions of notebooks and entire courses (folders of
notebooks on a single topic).

To get started, please start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/issues/new?template=example_request.yaml) and proposing the notebook
or course you'd like to contribute. Once your proposal is accepted, draft
your notebook and submit it for review as a pull request. We hold learn notebooks to a high
standard, and we may go through a few rounds of reviews before your notebook
is merged.

Here's a contribution checklist:

- [ ] Include package dependencies in notebook files [using
  `--sandbox`](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/package_reproducibility/)
- [ ] If adding a course, include a `README.md`
- [ ] Keep language direct and simple.

If you aren't comfortable adding a new notebook or course, you can also request
what you'd like to see by [filing an issue](https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/issues/new?template=example_request.yaml).
