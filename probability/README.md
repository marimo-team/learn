# Learn probability

🚧 _This collection is a work in progress. Check back later for new noteboks._

This collection of marimo notebooks teaches the fundamentals of probability,
with an emphasis on computation with Python.


**Running notebooks.** To run a notebook locally, use

```bash
uvx marimo edit <URL>
```

For example, run the numbers tutorial with

```bash
uvx marimo edit https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/probability/00_sets.py
```

You can also open notebooks in our online playground by appending `marimo.app/`
to a notebook's URL: [marimo.app/https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/pprobability/00_sets.py](https://marimo.app/https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/probability/00_sets.py).
