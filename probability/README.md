# Learn probability

This collection of marimo notebooks teaches the fundamentals of probability,
with an emphasis on computation with Python.

Much of the structure and many explanations here are adapted from Chris Piech's [Probability for Computer Scientists](https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientists/en/index.html) course reader.


**Running notebooks.** To run a notebook locally, use

```bash
uvx marimo edit <URL>
```

For example, run the numbers tutorial with

```bash
uvx marimo edit https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/probability/01_sets.py
```

You can also open notebooks in our online playground by appending `marimo.app/`
to a notebook's URL: [marimo.app/https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/probability/01_sets.py](https://marimo.app/https://github.com/marimo-team/learn/blob/main/probability/01_sets.py).

**Thanks to all our notebook authors!**
