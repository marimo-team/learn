Learn matplotlib  
This collection of marimo notebooks teaches the fundamentals of data visualization with Matplotlib, Python’s core plotting library.

You’ll learn how to create and customize bar charts, histograms, line plots, and scatterplots — with an emphasis on clarity, aesthetics, and interactivity.
